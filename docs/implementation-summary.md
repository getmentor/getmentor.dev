# Implementation Summary: Containerization and Kubernetes Deployment

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of containerization and Kubernetes deployment for the GetMentor.dev application. The goal was to create a flexible solution that can be deployed to various cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, and Yandex Cloud.

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile**: A multi-stage build for the Next.js application that optimizes image size and follows best practices.

2. **Kubernetes Manifests** (in `k8s/base/`):
   - `namespace.yaml`: Defines the getmentor namespace
   - `deployment.yaml`: Defines the application deployment with resource limits and environment variables
   - `service.yaml`: Exposes the application within the cluster
   - `configmap.yaml`: Stores non-sensitive configuration
   - `secret.yaml`: Template for storing sensitive information
   - `ingress.yaml`: Configures external access to the application with TLS
   - `hpa.yaml`: Configures automatic scaling based on CPU and memory usage

3. **GitHub Actions Workflows** (in `.github/workflows/`):
   - `deploy-aws-eks.yml`: Workflow for deploying to AWS EKS
   - `deploy-gcp-gke.yml`: Workflow for deploying to GCP GKE
   - `deploy-yandex-cloud.yml`: Workflow for deploying to Yandex Cloud

4. **Documentation** (in `docs/`):
   - `containerization-plan.md`: Detailed plan for containerization and Kubernetes deployment
   - `kubernetes-deployment.md`: Comprehensive guide for deploying to Kubernetes

## Key Features

- **Multi-stage Docker build** for optimized image size
- **Resource limits** aligned with application requirements
- **Health checks** for improved reliability
- **Automatic scaling** based on CPU and memory usage
- **TLS configuration** for secure access
- **Environment variable management** using ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **CI/CD workflows** for automated deployment to multiple cloud providers

## Next Steps

1. **Review the implementation**: Examine the files created and ensure they meet your requirements.

2. **Set up cloud infrastructure**: Create the necessary resources in your chosen cloud provider(s):
   - Kubernetes cluster
   - Container registry
   - IAM roles and service accounts
   - DNS configuration

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets**: Add the necessary secrets to your GitHub repository for the CI/CD workflows.

4. **Deploy the application**: Follow the instructions in `docs/kubernetes-deployment.md` to deploy the application.

5. **Monitor and optimize**: After deployment, monitor the application's performance and resource usage, and adjust the configuration as needed.

## Customization Options

- **Resource limits**: Adjust CPU and memory limits in `k8s/base/deployment.yaml`
- **Scaling parameters**: Modify min/max replicas and scaling thresholds in `k8s/base/hpa.yaml`
- **Ingress configuration**: Update hostnames and TLS settings in `k8s/base/ingress.yaml`
- **Environment variables**: Add or modify environment variables in `k8s/base/configmap.yaml` and `k8s/base/secret.yaml`

## Additional Considerations

- **Backup and disaster recovery**: Implement a backup solution for your data
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana
- **Logging**: Configure centralized logging with tools like ELK or Cloud Logging
- **Security scanning**: Implement container image scanning in your CI/CD pipeline
- **Cost optimization**: Monitor resource usage and adjust limits to optimize costs
